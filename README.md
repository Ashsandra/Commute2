This is a more finalized version of the Openstax Commute Android App. It has a complete UI, displays Openstax textbook and is able to
read out the text. It also enables features like saving translated speech as local audio files, jumping to anywhere in 
the passage and starts reading from there, switching between the "music mode" and "reading mode", highlighting 
the text currently being read, etc..
